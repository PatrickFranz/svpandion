<!-- intro -->
<h1>Where do we go from here?</h1>

<p>As it happens in most social situations, the fact we live on a boat, and are planning on sailing off into the sunset often gets brought up. "Where are you going to go?" is always the question, and until the other day, the answer was a vague, "well, south".</p>

<p>We wanted to start our year with a plan, so a couple of days before the ball dropped in Times Square we gathered our tools and a cocktail and sat down with the determination that we weren't leaving the table till we had our plan, no matter how many cocktails it takes!</p>

<p>As we get closer to our 'cast off' day, we are finding we need more of a concrete(ish) plan for a few reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We need to plan around seasonal weather patterns</li>
  <li>We need to figure out our longer passages where we might want extra crew aboard</li>
  <li>Having a date, helps to motivate project completions</li>
</ul>

<p>Well it turns out we had our plan mostly figured out and agreed upon before we even started so it was just a matter of attaching a timeline. Only one cocktail was required.</p>

<!-- overall plan -->
<h2>What's the Big Idea</h2>
<p>So far our plan is to follow the Pacific Circuit, which runs clockwise from San Francisco. This route is popular due to all of the 'hot spots' that are included. It also involves a number of big passages.</p>

<p>The big picture looks something like this.</p>
<p>
  <span class='sv-title'><strong>First Leg</strong></span>
  <span class='sv-dates'><i>October - March</i></span>
</p>
<div class="sv-cols">
  <div class='sv-leg-info'>
    <p class='sv-destinations'>
      San Francisco <img src="assets/images/arrow-right-solid.svg" alt="Right Arrow"> 
      San Diego <img src="assets/images/arrow-right-solid.svg" alt="Right Arrow"> 
      Cabo San Lucas
    </p>
    <p>
      We cast off lines in Redwood City and begin the trip south after passing under the incredible Golden Gate bridge one more (last?) time. If the winds and weather cooperate we should be in San Diego in about 7 days time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We haven't decided wether or not to join the <a href="http://www.baja-haha.com/">Baja-Haha</a> yet. Either way the route is the same, we can just take our time if we go on our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      From San Diego it's another 10-15 days to Cabo San Lucas, depending if we stop at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XH47v5qd3nG2">Islas de San Bonita</a> for some spearfishing and exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we get to Cabo, we'll make our way north to La Paz and some serious tropical islanding!

    </p>
    <p>
      This is the big one! The crossing (known as The Puddlejump) will take between 20-30 days of continious sailing. This means no land, no cell phones, no people and obviously no getting off the boat for a month! 
    </p>
    <p>Kinda sounds dreamy! =D</p>
    <p>Once we get there though ... I mean this is the quintessential tropical island paradise that as a Canadian, freezing my fanny off in January, I would be dreaming about.</p>
    <p>On a boat, this is a playground of islands, polynesian culture, snorkelling, and fishing in crystal blue WARM waters.</p>
    <p>The plan is to hang out here for as long as possible. There is a lot to explore and one season may not be enough. There is a possibility of leaving the boat here, while we come home to make some $$, and let Everest attend High School.</p>

<p>Of course, plans can change and there is also a possibility of sticking to the coast and heading to Central/South America. The sailing to the Galapagos Islands and even Easter Island. Or primary goal is to stay safe, stay happy, and explore.</p>

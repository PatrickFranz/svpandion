SV Pandion is a sailing vessel with a small quirky family aboard. Patrick is an IT professional, web developer, rock climber and avid sailor. Tara is a Sociologist who works in UX Research, teaches yoga and is becoming an avid canvas fabricator. Everest is a young rock star who is passionate about music, video games and his love of pugs, especially our little boat pet Salty the Pug.  

We’ve been sailing primarily around the San Francisco Bay near the Golden Gate and in the Monterey Bay. We’ve sailed the Cyclades in Greece with some great friends and have been slowly growing our passion for sailing. We loved it immediately and have been planning a long trip for a few years now. 

We were lucky enough to find Pandion and purchase her from an awesome family who also took Pandion cruising across the Pacific. We loved Pandion from the first time we saw her and have been so happy living on Pandion and continuing to improve the vessel. In April 2017 we moved onto the boat and live on Pandion full time. We commute to work and school from the marina, but from time to time we do anchor out for a weekend or more of sailing. 

Our dream is to seek out life and adventure while we can and not wait for it to come to us.
